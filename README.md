The program works by running the main script ("main.py") in the EmailTools directory.

Currently, you cannot change user settings within the program, but if you use your favourite sqlite browser or interface, you can change your user settings (mainly the max number of lines in an email to type - I recommend 10-15 max.)

Please report any EIDs for emails with flagrant spelling and grammar mistakes, or with really sensitive personal information.
